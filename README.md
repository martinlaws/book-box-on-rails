# BookBox

## What is this?

BookBox is the digital incarnation of the classic hostel/caf√©/street corner Book Swap.

Do you have books lying around that you'll never touch again? Of course you do.

Don't you hate how the library only gives you a week or two to get through a whole book? HOW FAST DO YOU THINK I READ, LIBRARIANS?

When you swap on BookBox, the new book is yours. Forever. Or until you swap it all over again.

## How does it work?

*Simple*  
1. Make an account.  
2. Pick a book you'd like to swap (the available books are automatically sorted by proximity to you!)  
3. Give back to the community, you selfish muppet! Post some of your old books for swapping!  
4. Accept or decline incoming trades. (accepting a trade will transfer ownership of the book to its new owner)  

## Have questions?

No you don't! It's too damn simple!

## TODO

* ~~implement location~~
* email notifications for incoming and accepted trades
* 'time-picker' for posting and receiving user to set a time to meet-up for book hand-off
* option to offer a currently-owned book on trade
* Google Maps API for current location of book and book trade history
* ~~query Goodreads for book information~~
